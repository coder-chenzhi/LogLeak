The Orbic Wonder27 Android device provides a method to obtain the logcat logs via a pre-installed platform app with a package name of com.ckt.mmitest (versionCode=25, versionName=7.1.2) that will write the logcat logs to the SD card when a specific activity is started. Any app that requests the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission can read from the SD card and also the created logcat log file. Therefore, a local app on the device can quickly start a specific activity application component (com.ckt.mmitest.MmiMainActivity) in the app (com.ckt.mmitest) to have the logcat log get written to the SD card. After starting the app with a specific flag in the intent (FLAG_ACTIVITY_EXCLUDE_FROM_RECENTS), the app can programmatically return to the home screen and the app (com.ckt.mmitest) will not be visible in the recent apps. Then the logcat log will be continually written and can be mined on the device for sensitive user data. Alternatively, the entire log file can be exfiltrated to a remote location for processing. An example file path that the logs get written to is /sdcard/MmiTest/fd5d9b82_0202-221453.log. This file name may vary, but the directory will be the same. The source code below will initiate the writing of the logcat log file to external storage. The first intent will start the activity application component which initiates the writing of the logcat log to the SD card. This intent contains a flag that will hide it from the recent apps list. The thread then sleeps 0.7 seconds. Then it launches an intent to return to the home screen, so the app is no longer visible or accessible to the user via the recent apps list. This can be done in the background from a service application component.

Intent i = new Intent();
i.setClassName("com.ckt.mmitest", "com.ckt.mmitest.MmiMainActivity");
i.setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_EXCLUDE_FROM_RECENTS);
this.startActivity(i);
try {
	Thread.sleep(700);
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
	e.printStackTrace();
}
Intent i2 = new Intent("android.intent.action.MAIN");
i2.addCategory(Intent.CATEGORY_HOME);
startActivity(i2);
