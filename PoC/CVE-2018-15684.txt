Unauthenticated Access to PHP Logs
PHP errors are logged by default to files found in /include/logs. As this directory does not have an index in place, the file names do not need to be guessed and can be easily accessed.

Should an index file be placed, the files use a predictable naming convention by default - making it possible to still access them. By default, the base name of the log file will be xbtit-errors and the log will be rotated each day with the date appended to the end of the base name in the _DD.MM.YY_ format. For example, the log file for the 19th August 2018 would be found at /include/logs/xbtit-errors_19.08.18_.log.

These logs result in full path disclosure and can potentially contain sensitive information such as passwords.
